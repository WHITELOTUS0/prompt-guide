# Intro to Prompting Guide

When utilizing large language models, prompt engineering emerges as one of the most critical topics to learn. It is possible to achieve the same level of accuracy by crafting the right prompt, even when opting for less powerful or open-source models. Here, we will explore the art of writing the perfect prompt, equipping you with the skills to maximize the potential of your models and get the response in the specified format. Furthermore, few-shot prompts provide a unique opportunity to enable the models to quickly acquire new knowledge and generalize to unseen tasks with minimal data, offering a remarkable capability for customization.
